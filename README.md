EduMedia is a cross-platform mobile application that connects students, parents, and educators by offering a platform to meet everyone's school-related needs. Communicate with teachers quickly using our live chat feature, browse offered clubs, view upcoming events, post pictures to school/club-wide galleries and so much more!

## Login
The `Login` screen signs in the user, directing them to the correct page depending on their role. Students have premade accounts, and parents are given the option to create new accounts linking to their child. We secure client information by hiding passwords, only storing password hashes, and using email verification to verify new accounts.

## Home
The `Home` screen includes navigation to view the user's information and settings along with the user's (or their child's) schedule. The bottom tab menu allows users to move quickly between the different features.
